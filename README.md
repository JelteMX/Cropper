# Image Cropper Widget

Image Cropper widget is a widget that will do image cropping, rotating and editing completely client-side, using [Cropper.js v1.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs)

It needs an context entity object that is a generalization of 'System.Image' to work (DataView)

**This is work-in-progress, not in the AppStore and not production ready**

TODO:

* Add more options that can be done in CropperJS
* Add history (go back/forward), save files in memory
